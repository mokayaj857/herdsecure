HerdSecure:  Protecting Kenyan  Pastoralists and  their Cattle


Cattle rustling has been a longstanding issue in Kenya, causing significant economic losses and posing a threat to human lives. Over the past few years, the country has lost over 50 billion Kenya shillings annually to this menace, with the numbers continuing to rise. Furthermore, the toll on human lives is evident, with 30 casualties reported in 2019 alone within the first five months. This alarming trend underscores the urgent need for innovative solutions to combat cattle rustling and safeguard both livelihoods and lives.
In response to this pressing challenge, we introduce HerdSecure, a pioneering project aimed at mitigating the impacts of cattle rustling and fostering sustainable development in Kenya. HerdSecure not only addresses the immediate economic losses associated with cattle theft but also aligns with key United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
